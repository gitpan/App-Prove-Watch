NAME

    App::Prove::Watch - Run tests whenever changes occur.

VERSION

    version 0.1

SYNOPSIS

            $ provewatcher 

DESCRIPTION

    Watches for changes in the current directroy tree and runs prove when
    there are changes.

ARGUMENTS

    provwatcher takes all the arguments that prove takes with two
    additions:

 --watch

    Specifies what directories should be watched:

            # just watch lib
            $ provewatcher --watch lib
            
            # watch lib and t
            $ provewatcher --watch lib --watch t
            

    This defaults to . if not given.

 --run

    Allows you to run something other than prove when changes happen. For
    example if you where using Dist::Zilla

            $ provewatcher --run 'dzil test'
            

NOTIFICATIONS

    If you install Log::Dispatch::DesktopNotification, desktop
    notifications will be sent whenever the overall state of the tests
    change (failing to passing or passing to failing).

    Log::Dispatch::DesktopNotification is not listed as a prereq for this
    module, it will not be installed by default when you install this
    module.

TODO

      * Ironically, for a TDD tool, there's not enough tests.

      * The provewatch script needs documentation.
